The repo shows how to implement CMU OAuth (sign-in with CMU Account) in your own web app using Next.js + TypeScript. We get CMU basic info (like student name, student id,..) after signing in then we use this information to create our own session.

## Please do the following steps before you start

1. Run **npm install** in your terminal.
2. Update the .env file. Copy your CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET to the .env.
3. Update NEXT_PUBLIC_CMU_OAUTH_URL variable in the .env
4. Run **npm run dev**

## Warning

This repo include .env file to kickstart required variables for you. But in practice, you should not include .env in repository at all!
